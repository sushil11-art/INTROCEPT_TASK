npm install react-redux
# Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework, including React. Although Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each other.React Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React.

npm install redux-devtools-extension

# Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.

# Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL.

# Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
